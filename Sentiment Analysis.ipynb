       "('\"Any Batman fan will know just how great the films are, they\\'ve been a major success. Batman Returns however is by far the best film in the series. A combination of excellent directing, brilliant acting and settings makes this worthy of watching on a night in.<br /><br />Tim Burton, who directed this movie, has specifically made sure that this film gives a realistic atmosphere and he\\'s done a great job. Danny Devito (Penguin man) is a man who has inherited penguin characteristics as a baby, and grown up to become a hideous and ugly...thing! Michelle Pfiffer plays the sleek and very seducing \\'Catwoman\\' after cats had given her there genes from being bitten. The result in both the character changes is excellent and both Catwoman and Penguin man play a very important role in this excellent film. The mysterious Catwoman is great fun to watch - her classic sayings and a funny part in which skips with her whip in a jewelry shop adds such fun to the film. Danny Devito also does well, his ability to impersonate some strange creature was vital, and he adds a great atmosphere to the film that takes us back to the dull sewers where he lives.<br /><br />You can\\'t forget Batman though. Micheal Keaton once again pulls of a comfortable performance, and shows us a different side to Batman. His affection is let loose when he confronts Catwoman at the end of the film, and his meetings with her when she\\'s a normal person, Selina Kyle, result in him being seduced badly in his own home. There\\'s a clever part after this when they leave, and the film is full of great scenes. Its worth noting that Bruce Wayne\\'s Bat mobile is not used as much as in the other Batman films, as close combat and story telling scenes make up this film.<br /><br />The winter setting is created perfectly in Gotham City with most of the scenes being set at night, and with the town being filled with snow. Therefore, if you watch this film during the summer like I have, it doesn\\'t feel the same. Best watch it during the winter.<br /><br />Overall, its an amazing movie. All the credit goes to Tom Burton and the cast, they\\'ve done an incredible job.\"',\n",
